# CIAT
Deliverable of writing test.


To do this test, I used the next software:
  Pentaho 9.1
  MySql 8.0
  Java JDK 16.0.1
  Java JRE 8u91
  sqljdbc_4.2.8112.200_enu
  MySQL_Conector_Java8.024
  
Once  I have installed all the software, I created the environmental variables ,
After that I created a DB in MySql Workbench named Casa with user root and password “micasa”
I tested the connections between Pentaho and Mysql and start the jobs.

Notes.
I decided to change the null values to 999 

POWERBI Dashboard
I created a new datasheet with the unique identifiers of the projects, to get the real number of projects.
The original data is referred as Disaggregated data.
Thanks
